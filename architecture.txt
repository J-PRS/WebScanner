# Scanner Project Architecture

## Overview
A web-based QR code scanner application that allows users to scan QR codes and manage scanned items. The application is built using modern web technologies and follows a client-server architecture.

## Technical Stack
- Frontend: HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- QR Code Scanning: html5-qrcode library
- Backend: Python (Flask) for development server
- Audio: Web Audio API for scan feedback

## System Architecture

### Frontend Components
1. **UI Components**
   - Camera container for QR scanning
   - Scanned items list
   - Share button for exporting data
   - Alternative input container for manual entry

2. **Core Features**
   - Real-time QR code scanning
   - Audio feedback on successful scans
   - List management (add/remove items)
   - Data sharing capabilities
   - Camera availability detection
   - Manual input fallback

3. **State Management**
   - Client-side state for scanned items
   - Local storage for persistence
   - Temporary storage for session data

### Backend Components
1. **Development Server**
   - Python-based development server
   - Debug endpoint for logging
   - Static file serving
   - CORS handling

2. **API Endpoints**
   - `/debug`: POST endpoint for client-side debugging
   - Static file serving endpoints

## Security Considerations
- Camera access is handled through browser permissions
- Data is stored locally on the client
- No sensitive information is transmitted to the server
- Secure audio context initialization

## Performance Optimization
- Efficient QR code scanning implementation
- Optimized audio feedback
- Responsive UI design
- Camera resource management

## Error Handling
- Graceful camera fallback
- User-friendly error messages
- Debug logging system
- Resource cleanup on page unload

## Future Expansion Points
1. **Feature Enhancements**
   - Cloud storage integration
   - Advanced data analysis
   - Batch processing capabilities

2. **Technical Improvements**
   - Mobile optimization
   - Offline capabilities
   - Enhanced security features

3. **Integration Opportunities**
   - API integration with other services
   - Customizable scanning profiles
   - Advanced data export formats
